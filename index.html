<div class="chaptertitle" id="intro">Introduction</div>


When I was a kid I one had this sudden realisation that people working in shops were just people. I had this idea that they were some sort of super-humans, knowing every single detail of each product they sold. They were adults in uniforms with logos on them, and that obviously meant they knew everything. 
<br/> <br/>

If you think about it, however, the idea of credibility in our everyday environment comes mostly from aspects of uniformity: wearing the same shirt, with the same logo, accompanied by actions like standing behind the counter and walking around with a name card on a strap around your neck.
<br/> <br/>

Around the same time, I was determined to be a journalist. I devoured books faster than my mum could buy new ones to keep me distracted, and the idea of having my own newspaper one day was one I entertained quite often. A lucky situation then arose: I got my first computer. At the time, I was about twelve years old, and the possibilities of having your own personal space on the web were enhanced by a multitude of blog platforms like BlogSpot and Wordpress, usually free services with a selection of templates, offering a subdomain that you’d benefit from while still promoting the service that made it possible. This gave me an opportunity that before I had only come close to by making my handwritten booklets that I’d give to my parents and whoever was interested: I could have my own platform. And with a template I had achieved a level of credibility I had never got close to with my scribbled stapled A4’s.
<br/> <br/>

Yet another significant realisation I had was while looking for more templates that would fit whatever design concerns I had at the time, and stumbled into an “about the webmaster page” of a blog I liked, most likely in the hopes of finding out where they got their template from. To my surprise, not only the author of this blog was only a few years older than me, but she had also managed to design her own page. Her header was some sort of digital collage of different pictures, some of them were of people and the others were of strawberries, because it was about a popular Portuguese TV show for young people called “Strawberries With Sugar”. 
<br/> <br/>

So, in a short period of time, I realised brands are made of normal people, anyone could have their own platform on this amazing thing called the Internet, I could make advanced collage work by downloading all this software I could barely pronounce and following tutorials made by a growing community of (mostly) teenagers with an Internet access. It was profoundly groundbreaking for someone who previously assumed that only a group of experienced middle-aged men (probably in uniforms) could have combined people and strawberries in such an effortless fashion.
<br/> <br/>

Both of these epiphanies are connected due to their demystifying nature: weather it was triggered by a newly hired and therefore still clueless employee at a shop or by an honest first-person account on their self-designed fanblog, it enabled me to deconstruct a reality that before seemed out of reach. 
<br/> <br/>

Of course that at the mere age of twelve I did not think of it as the sudden realisation of the several mediatic strategies I was surrounded by, or the influence that shaping the very same media I was consuming would have on my perception of visual culture and how it could be related to events such as the digital revolution. I thoroughly enjoyed adding up to the constant flow of digital collages featuring celebrities and fruits, or any other trend I could replicate with the skills I gained in the privacy of my own house. However, it was the self-reflective exercise that preceded the writing of this thesis that led me to see the importance of these events. 
<br/> <br/>

The practical process of creating the very same media I was consuming, enabled by the availability of a desktop computer and the access to the Internet, allowed me to engage with it in an entirely new and different way. The starting point of this thesis was thus the connection between a digital literacy fostered by the advent of digital technology, and a more critical understand of the media that surrounded me. 
<br/> <br/>

The development of the younger generations’ understanding of media is one that is undoubtedly linked to technology developments, that are also a major factor in the widening of the so-called “generation gaps” of the past. With a goal of creating a body of work that is as contextually and historically aware as it is technology progressive, I’ve structure this thesis into four articles that focus on our perception of media, more specifically visual culture, throughout three major technological developments: The invention of the printing press, the Industrial Revolution and the Digital Revolution. 
<br/> <br/>

While my interest on the topic is clearly relevant from my point of view as a graphic designer it starts by addressing issues that relate to visual art, as the endeavour of giving an appropriate contextual basis for graphic design relies also on the broader topics of visual studies and art history in order to address society’s relationship with a culture where the visual is progressively more dominant.
<br/> <br/>







<div class="chaptertitle" id="myth">The myth of artist hood, art history, the printing press</div>



In 1550 Giorgio Vasari published the book that became known as the first extensive study of European Art: Lives of the Artists. Based on interviews, correspondence and field trips, the book explores the lives of a generation of artists from the Quattrocento and is considered one of the most important books about art ever written and the most essential guide to the Italian Renaissance, a term he coined himself. It’s a monumental encyclopaedia of sculptors, architects and painters. The invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg a century before, in 1440, allowed the Lives to be a bestseller in a time marked by the rapid growth of learning made possible by the availability of large numbers of inexpensive books. Before the invention of metal movable type, all printing was done manually in laborious processes; this revolution in printing brought books out of the church and into the universities, bridging the medieval world with modern history. 

<br/> <br/>

Gutenberg’s relevance to this topic of the Lives could perhaps be extended to more than just its publishing. The fact that he is acknowledged by his invention is something particular to its time. People who created things were not usually recognised until this period, for reasons that are a subject of debate among historians. The rise of science and the rediscovery of ancient philosophy are cited among them as well as the lost of church authority in the late middle ages and the following Reformation. Before that, creation was reserved for divinity and those with divine inspiration and the fact that human beings could make things was not something anyone would give much thought beforehand. Apart from a few exceptions like Greek philosophers, engineers and a few Chinese artists, our knowledge of who made what started around the thirteenth century and increased during the European Renaissance. 

<br/> <br/>

Although authorship started to be a more prevailing concept – the first patents were issued in Italy in the fifteenth century – and finally also linked to humans, it still had a mystical connotation as these humans had to be great: Michelangelo, Rafael, Leonardo and all the genius masters. Vasari’s Lives as a collection of interviews and personal stories seems to have the promise of demystifying the life of these and other artists he dedicated his life studying, but his own fascination with them, combined with the huge popularity of the book and the fact it was the first of its kind, may have added even more to the fire of perpetual mysticism surrounding creation, and consequently artisthood and visual culture.

<br/> <br/>

Vasari came from a family of tradesmen, and his father encouraged Giorgio’s talent for drawing as he spent a good portion of his time copying the pictures he found in the churches of Arezzo, the Tuscan town where he was born in 1511. In 1524 and through a family connection, he was introduced to Cardinal Silvio Passerini, who put him to study with Michelangelo in Florence. Even though it never truly happened as Michelangelo was sent to Rome almost immediately after that arrangement, the first encounter between older and already established Michelangelo and the young Vasari proved to be extremely important. Vasari came to worship Michelangelo as an artist and man and the scheme and structure of Lives, published a quarter of a century after they met, seems to depend completely on the climax provided by the life of Michelangelo. 

<br/> <br/>

The Lives were then subject not only to historical circumstances of sixteenth century Italy but also to the biased opinion of their author: Vasari was entirely obsessed with art. His own artistic practice was belittled by the success and status of his book about the artists he admired, and in fact, the latter is likely far more personal than his paintings and architectural works as in it emerge his fascination, humour, wittiness and calculating nature. 

<br/> <br/>

The biased, fascinated account of these artists have undeniably influenced art history as a whole (Vasari is often referred to as the first art historian), but also our perception of the artists and the established ways and methods in which they produce and exist in the context of our society. Vasari’s own understanding of these matters is clear in his writings, and the incredible success of his book brings these opinions closer to a, at the time, developing collective memory, moved forward by the advent of print technologies.

<br/> <br/>


<b>The artist a messenger of god </b>
<div class="quote">
“Michelangelo, who, as was clearly recognised, achieved in the three arts [painting, sculpture, architecture] a perfect mastery that God has granted no other person, in the ancient or modern world, in all the years that the sun has been spinning round the world.”
</div>

<br/> 


<b>The artist as unbeatable source of effortless talent  </b>
<div class="quote">
“Michelangelo had a strong vocation for the arts on which he laboured, and he succeeded in everything he did, no matter how difficult. (…) everything he made, whether with the brush or the chisel, defies imitation, and (as has been said) is imbued with such art, grace, and distinctive vitality that, if this can be said without offence, he has surpassed and vanquished the ancients, for the facility with which he achieved difficult effects was so great that they seem to have been created without effort, although anyone who tries to copy his work finds a great deal of effort is needed.”
</div>

<br/> 


<b>The artist in solitude/ The artist as an exception in society</b>
<div class="quote">
“No one should think it strange that Michelangelo loves solitude, for he was deeply in love with his art, which claims a man with all this thoughts for itself alone. Anyone who wants to devote himself to the study of art must shun the society of others. In fact, a man who gives his time to the problems of art is never alone and never lacks food for thought, and those who attribute an artist’s love of solitude to outlandishness and eccentricity are mistaken, being that anyone who wants to do good work must rid himself of all cares and burdens: the artist most have time and opportunity for reflection and solitude and concentration.”
</div>

<br/> 


The very fact the biographies of these artists are rich in personal comments also suggests the authority of personal, subjective knowledge. This, as well as the structure of the book, organised by artist, draws attention to the maker as an essential part of understanding art and works of art. In general, Vasari’s descriptions in the way they refer to a general identity of “the artist” also emphasise how glorified his notion of someone who produces art is. The ways in which he talks about each artist in particular but still refers to all of them in the exact same term shows a notion of classification that is in the basis of art history: it creates a framework of values that unconsciously extends into not only the public’s perception of art, but also the making of art in itself. 

<br/> <br/>
<div class="quote">
“Even a decision as simple as studying only one period in an artist’s career has consequences. Whether intended or not, it separates some of the work from the rest, and does so using the artist’s life to define the group. That such choices are made by art historians all the time is unavoidable, but they must be understood as choices. Objects do not come labeled this way.”
<br/>
<div class="caption"> Munsterberg, M. (2009). Writing about art (Rev. ed.). New York: Www.writingaboutart.org. </div>
</div>

<br/> 


While art history and analysis have come far since Lives, it is still primarily a field of knowledge that relies on the dissection of final products rather than on the complexity of their expression and working methods. An emphasis on the context in which the work was made, including previous artistic endeavours by the artist, their historical framework and unfinished work may suggest a more immediate access to the creative process and its leading personality. 

<br/> <br/>





<div class="chaptertitle" id="studio">How does the social perception of the artist influence their creative practice? – On the studio as site of production, context and subject</div>


The relationship between artists and their workspace, the studio, has been one subjected to social, cultural and technological advancements as much as art itself. Before the Renaissance the concept of a studio was not as prevailing one due to the centralised infrastructure of the Church that dominated artistic production: artists worked within the spaces they were commissioned to work for, like monasteries and other religious establishments.  As artists started to develop more meaningful and long-lasting relationship with their commissioners – or patrons – they started to become dependant on this relationship rather than on specific locations. There was, however, a variety of contexts for the idea of the studio. The artist’s work was carried out in the bottega – the workshop or workroom – while the studiolo was a room for study and contemplation and would be in a separate space, although usually in the same building. This division already indicates a split in the perception of art production: the physical, practical work and the analysis and reflection – they were seen as different processes. This changed in the Romantic period, when the studio become both a space for practical work and introspection that was inherent to the idea of the artist at the time. The studio was a major factor in the wellspring of the artist’s persona and perceived creative genius. 
<br/> <br/>

Despite changes in artistic attitudes and preferences, the premise of the studio remained largely the same from its prevalence through the 1800s. The beginning of industrial production had huge consequences for artists. If before they had to produce their own paints in laborious mixing processes, now paint was widely available in ready to use aluminium tubes. Along with paint, lightweight portable easels and brushes could be produced in large quantities and easily purchased at a store. These developments enabled an entire new way of painting known as en plain air – in open air – and artists across Europe could pack their materials and paint nature. Painting became an activity of leisure, an autonomous pursuit, without necessarily having to depend on the artist’s relationship with a patron: l’art pour l’art, literally “art for art”. 
<br/> <br/>

A new availability of materials in a fast-changing world as a major force in the break of classicism and realistic methods of representation meant that visual art stopped being associated with specific modes and objects of production, a legacy that is part of the avant-garde. This newly found autonomy had an enormous role in the production, commercialisation and perception of art. “Anyone could do that”, a very common reaction do modern art, is a part of this irremediable process of deskilling, as the artist was now disconnected from mainstream forms of production and productivity due to his newly gained autonomous identity. If this disconnection – even if milder and a consequence of a different context – had been embraced in the past by romantic artists, in the modern area the idea that artists were solitary creatures that could do things ordinary people couldn’t was systematically fought against by artists themselves. They not only defied the previous genres and tradition associated with art, but also the standards of skill and craftsmanship that validated it and consequently, challenged their own position as artists. 
<br/> <br/>

<div class="quote">“(…) the modern system of the arts came together in the eighteenth century partly in connection with the development of a market for art among the growing middle class. In the new system, Fine Art (art with a capital “A”) was divided from the crafts as the appropriate object of refined taste, and usefulness became rather a negative than a positive feature for a work of art. Art for Art’s sake, the Artist as Visionary Genius, and the unique Aesthetic Attitude/Experience emerged as the distinguishing features of Fine Art. New institutions devoted to the arts, such as galleries, museums, concert halls and libraries, were a central part of the new system. (…) The distinguishing characteristics of the modern system are themselves new, and together they create a dramatically new set of expectations. One of these is the negative value of utility when considering a work of art. Art is supposed to be made for its own sake, not for some other purpose. Of course it may serve a purpose; but in the modern system it only counts as Art if it is valuable on its own independent of that purpose. Shiner gives a number of examples to establish that this expectation is indeed new. Likewise, the notion of the Artist as Creative Genius is significantly altered in the modern system. Genius itself is a very old idea, a version of the idea of divine inspiration. But in the modern system the artist is a genius rather than being inspired by a genius, and what genius generates is not so much preternatural skill as innovation beyond rules. In other words, genius is no longer the characteristic of an artisan.”</div>
<div class="caption">A Third System of the Arts? An Exploration of Some Ideas from Larry Shiner's The Invention of Art: A Cultural History. (n.d.). </div>

<br/> 

As classical notions of art were being questioned throughout the 19th century, the studio started to become a target for critique. By the 1960’s, the studio was declared to have fallen and lost both its conventional prominence and mythical stature – the “imagination’s chamber”, a concept reinforced during the Romantic period, became seemingly outdated, as it represented a type of artistic practice, material production and creative identity that artists wished to overcome or even avoid altogether. 
<br/> <br/>

<div class="quote">“The transformation of the superstructure, which takes place far more slowly than that of the substructure, has taken more than half a century to manifest in all areas of culture the change in the conditions of production. Only today can it be indicated what form this has taken. Certain prognostic requirements should be met by these statements. However, theses about the art of the proletariat after its assumption of power or about the art of a classless society would have less bearing on these demands than theses about the developmental tendencies of art under present conditions of production. Their dialectic is no less noticeable in the superstructure than in the economy. It would therefore be wrong to underestimate the value of such theses as a weapon. They brush aside a number of outmoded concepts, such as creativity and genius, eternal value and mystery – concepts whose uncontrolled (and at present almost uncontrollable) application would lead to a processing of data in the Fascist sense. The concepts which are introduced into the theory of art in what follows differ from the more familiar terms in that they are completely useless for the purposes of Fascism. They are, on the other hand, useful for the formulation of revolutionary demands in the politics of art.” </div>
<div class="caption">Walter, Benjamin. The work of art in the age of mechanical reproduction, 1936 </div>
<br/> 

The new modes of making, distributing, presenting and experiencing art opposed the mythical aspect of the ritual of creating. The modern artist preferred to be identified with the worker rather than the aristocrat, and this contrasting view exposes the two main paradigms in the perception of making art and artists: the romantic, distant, solitary, magical idea, and the worker, avant-garde revolutionary. The studio, the traditionally designated site for artistic production becomes, for the first time, a reoccurring theme in art as it now had the autonomy, means and audience to be self-referential. 
<br/> <br/>

The desire to show the artistic methods and practices that go into the actual making of the work by displaying the original site of its production was an attempt to encourage a degree of critical distance in the viewer. Acknowledging that art is a construction, and that the artist is the one constructing it. 
<br/> <br/>


Every attempt to demystify art underlines the myth in a way or another and, at the same time, creates new myths for future generations to reject. Modern art and its premise of demystification also created its own myth: the deskilling and devalue of art validated itself and put the artist on a pedestal where he still stands today. Whatever the artist does, as nonsense and non-traditional as it may get, is it part of conceptualised idea of what it should be, and thus, valid. Using the studio as a subject in art itself is an attempt to demystify it as a site of artistic production, but it also becomes a counter-myth. Attempts to unravel the process of making by presenting its supposed spacial point of departure, ended up revealing the duality of the perception of the artist, serving both the romanticised idea of the workplace and the administrative notion of the office, and consequently, did not deconstruct the artistic process in its entirety. 


<br/> <br/>









<div class="chaptertitle" id="punk">Why is Punk Rock a Little Bit Like The Internet?</div>


The arts in the beginning of the 20th century were still dependent on the live artist or print to be transmitted to the audience. The possibilities enabled by the Industrialised’s world <i>mechanical reproduction</i> enabled art, or, more specifically, images of it, to be widely available and financially accessible which further encouraged its perceived ephemerality and lack of value in a growing consumer culture where art gained its place as a commodity. 

<br/> <br/>


One art form that is particularly linked to this phenomenon is one that, in its nature, does not rely on objects or imagery but would not exist in its known format without it: music. By the 1970’s music was established as part of an entertainment industry, in itself a cultural commodity. Propelled by the advent of the radio and development of the recording industry, music had had the technical possibilities and previous exposure to now be successfully distributed to larger audiences. Bands like Led Zeppelin, The Who and Queen were widely popular, their music music distributed and performed around the world, often in large venues and to a massive crowd that had paid to support the space, the complex musical equipment and the glorified, celebrity status of these musicians, now worshipped as artists, sex symbols, fashion icons and individuals. Rock as a movement was simultaneously part of a commercial product and a cultural phenomenon, and both of these aspects influenced and limited each other. The music industry used the cultural relationships developed around music by a sub-culture of youngsters as the raw material for the manufacture of their product. Once rock proved to me more than just music, the engine of commerce made the best out of it. 

<br/> <br/>


As consumer culture is based on the production of goods in large quantities, these had to appeal to the biggest number of people possible, without actually making it necessary getting to know every single one of them, and thus the concept of the “average consumer” was born. As individuality became a statistic for industries and advertisers, its effects on music became clearer and clearer, and the punk movement that emerged in the mid 1970’s addressed these issues by placing itself outside the mainstream, capitalism and consumerist media and creating its own methods of doing what it wanted to do. Challenging the notion of establishments, many bands were self-produced, self-recorded and relied on small pub performances rather than on big shows. The audiences were often included in these performances, invited to jump on stage, or joined in the crowd by the ones performing. Jumping off the pedestal or inviting the audience to climb onto it and see the view is part of the punk ethos. 

<br/ > <br/ >

The aesthetics of punk music are aggressive, straight-forward and accessible. The aggression inherent to punk is due to its existence as an act of insubordination. It says “no” to established modes of recording, commercialising and presenting music, by several means in which it bridged the gap between media and media consumer. The accessibility in it stems largely from its almost self-explanatory simplicity. Distancing itself from the glorified solos in rock music, a lot of punk songs required basic knowledge of music to be performed. Its place outside of any industry also implied a rare access to any sort of industrial equipment and so the posters, flyers, album packaging and zines matched its music from the perspective that they displayed a varying, yet always present level of amateurism. This unavoidable process of deskilling due the circumstances of its production lowered thresholds and empowered an audience that was no longer passive. Fighting the modern world consumerist idea of relying on others to satisfy needs, the do-it-yourself nature of punk showed people what they could do on their own, and with each other. 

<br/ > <br/ >

Even though DIY as a subculture started with the punk movement, its origins are traced to a wave of convention-breaking and experimentalism of the late 1960’s and early 1970’s. One of the hallmarks of this was the self-published “The Whole Earth Catalog”, by the young American visionary Stewart Brand, who did it by using basic typesetting and lay-outing tools. The first issue, subtitled “Access to tools”, was published in 1968 and it was an index of informational tools (often technical books), professional journals, courses, classes as well as carpenter’s, mason’s and garden tools and even early personal computers. Later editions saw a growing number of personal recommendations and reviews of everything from computational physics to goat husbandry. By including contact information of the manufacturer, lacking in ads and rich in personal comments it offered an alternative view of approaching the consumption of commodities.

<br/ > <br/ >

Brand’s vision promoted "the power of the individual to conduct his own education, find his own inspiration, and share his adventure.”. 




<div class="quote">
    “In the digital age, media education needs to foster both critical understanding and creative media production of new media to encourage urban youth to be consumers, designers and inventors of new technologies. (…) We see the approach of creative media production as an appropriate and healthy counterpoint to a culture of consumption. While the boundaries between media consumers and producers are perhaps not as distinct as they used to be, there is still a large rift between those who own and control media and those that have the possibilities of creating them. To be a full member in today’s participatory culture should mean much more than knowing how to play videogames, for example; it should also mean knowing how to design videogames.”

“Traditionally, educational researchers and practitioners have focused on the development of youths’ critical understanding of new media as one key aspect of digital literacy (Buckingham, 2003; Gilster, 2007). Today, youth not only consume media when browsing the Internet and sharing information on social networking sites, but they also produce content when contributing to blogs, designing animations, graphics and video productions (Ito et al., 2009). This new media landscape suggests an extension of what critical participation means in new media literacy, extending the metaphor of “reading the world to read the word” (Freire & Macedo, 1987) to include writing new media texts in a digital era. (…) More recently, these efforts to produce your own media have also been associated with the growing Do-It-Yourself, or DIY, movement (Guzetti & Yang, 2010; Knobel & Lankshear, 2010) involving arts, crafts, and new technologies (Eisenberg & Buechley, 2008; Spencer, 2007). Educators should be especially interested in DIY communities given the amount of time youth voluntarily spend in intense learning as they tackle highly technical practices, including film editing, robotics, and writing novels among a host of other activities across various DIY networks.”

In his book “Design as Art”, published in 1966, Bruno Munari starts by introducing Design as a means do “demolish the myth of the ‘star’ artist who only produces masterpieces for a small group of ultra-intelligent people.” He emphasises design’s role in the process of bridging the gap between the elitist nature of art and a society where culture is becoming a mass affair. Encouraging the role of the designer as an active middleman who is not afraid of the contemporary techniques, materials and working methods and who not only brings art closer to the people, but does it for people and with the idea of making the processes clear and engaging.

There is a very humble aspect to the embracing of the situation from which the discipline and practice of design emerged: rather than as a means to reinforce self-expression or educate, design situates itself somewhere in between media, culture, the industries that it serves and its audience. The economical growth propelled by the Industrial Revolution relied on design to distinguish between products and promote them. But how is the essence of design as a means to feed a capitalist society connected to its contemporary practice and its perception by people and designers themselves?

If the concept of design began to be shaped from the advent of print technology and further developed by an industrial mass-production that marked the beginning of the 20th century, the role of the designer is one that is constantly changing as it is not in itself an autonomous field: it exists in relationship to other things. Or does it?
<br/ > <br/ >

Authorship mostly suggests a relationship with content, and design is traditionally associated more with the communication than the origination of messages. However, as design is increasingly intruding the thought processes and spaces that were once solely designated for art, its practitioners seem to look for ways to legitimise their field, seemingly by using the very same concepts that have emerged in the visual arts as a way to differentiate between society and themselves.
