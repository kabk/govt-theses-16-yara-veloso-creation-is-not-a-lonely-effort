<div class="chaptertitle">Why is Punk Rock a Little Bit Like The Internet?</div>


The arts in the beginning of the 20th century were still dependent on the live artist or print to be transmitted to the audience. The possibilities enabled by the Industrialised’s world <i>mechanical reproduction</i> enabled art, or, more specifically, images of it, to be widely available and financially accessible which further encouraged its perceived ephemerality and lack of value in a growing consumer culture where art gained its place as a commodity. 

<br/> <br/>


One art form that is particularly linked to this phenomenon is one that, in its nature, does not rely on objects or imagery but would not exist in its known format without it: music. By the 1970’s music was established as part of an entertainment industry, in itself a cultural commodity. Propelled by the advent of the radio and development of the recording industry, music had had the technical possibilities and previous exposure to now be successfully distributed to larger audiences. Bands like Led Zeppelin, The Who and Queen were widely popular, their music music distributed and performed around the world, often in large venues and to a massive crowd that had paid to support the space, the complex musical equipment and the glorified, celebrity status of these musicians, now worshipped as artists, sex symbols, fashion icons and individuals. Rock as a movement was simultaneously part of a commercial product and a cultural phenomenon, and both of these aspects influenced and limited each other. The music industry used the cultural relationships developed around music by a sub-culture of youngsters as the raw material for the manufacture of their product. Once rock proved to me more than just music, the engine of commerce made the best out of it. 

<br/> <br/>


As consumer culture is based on the production of goods in large quantities, these had to appeal to the biggest number of people possible, without actually making it necessary getting to know every single one of them, and thus the concept of the “average consumer” was born. As individuality became a statistic for industries and advertisers, its effects on music became clearer and clearer, and the punk movement that emerged in the mid 1970’s addressed these issues by placing itself outside the mainstream, capitalism and consumerist media and creating its own methods of doing what it wanted to do. Challenging the notion of establishments, many bands were self-produced, self-recorded and relied on small pub performances rather than on big shows. The audiences were often included in these performances, invited to jump on stage, or joined in the crowd by the ones performing. Jumping off the pedestal or inviting the audience to climb onto it and see the view is part of the punk ethos. 

<br/ > <br/ >

The aesthetics of punk music are aggressive, straight-forward and accessible. The aggression inherent to punk is due to its existence as an act of insubordination. It says “no” to established modes of recording, commercialising and presenting music, by several means in which it bridged the gap between media and media consumer. The accessibility in it stems largely from its almost self-explanatory simplicity. Distancing itself from the glorified solos in rock music, a lot of punk songs required basic knowledge of music to be performed. Its place outside of any industry also implied a rare access to any sort of industrial equipment and so the posters, flyers, album packaging and zines matched its music from the perspective that they displayed a varying, yet always present level of amateurism. This unavoidable process of deskilling due the circumstances of its production lowered thresholds and empowered an audience that was no longer passive. Fighting the modern world consumerist idea of relying on others to satisfy needs, the do-it-yourself nature of punk showed people what they could do on their own, and with each other. 

<br/ > <br/ >

Even though DIY as a subculture started with the punk movement, its origins are traced to a wave of convention-breaking and experimentalism of the late 1960’s and early 1970’s. One of the hallmarks of this was the self-published “The Whole Earth Catalog”, by the young American visionary Stewart Brand, who did it by using basic typesetting and lay-outing tools. The first issue, subtitled “Access to tools”, was published in 1968 and it was an index of informational tools (often technical books), professional journals, courses, classes as well as carpenter’s, mason’s and garden tools and even early personal computers. Later editions saw a growing number of personal recommendations and reviews of everything from computational physics to goat husbandry. By including contact information of the manufacturer, lacking in ads and rich in personal comments it offered an alternative view of approaching the consumption of commodities.

<br/ > <br/ >

Brand’s vision promoted "the power of the individual to conduct his own education, find his own inspiration, and share his adventure.”. 




<div class="quote">
    “In the digital age, media education needs to foster both critical understanding and creative media production of new media to encourage urban youth to be consumers, designers and inventors of new technologies. (…) We see the approach of creative media production as an appropriate and healthy counterpoint to a culture of consumption. While the boundaries between media consumers and producers are perhaps not as distinct as they used to be, there is still a large rift between those who own and control media and those that have the possibilities of creating them. To be a full member in today’s participatory culture should mean much more than knowing how to play videogames, for example; it should also mean knowing how to design videogames.”

<div class="quote">

“Traditionally, educational researchers and practitioners have focused on the development of youths’ critical understanding of new media as one key aspect of digital literacy (Buckingham, 2003; Gilster, 2007). Today, youth not only consume media when browsing the Internet and sharing information on social networking sites, but they also produce content when contributing to blogs, designing animations, graphics and video productions (Ito et al., 2009). This new media landscape suggests an extension of what critical participation means in new media literacy, extending the metaphor of “reading the world to read the word” (Freire & Macedo, 1987) to include writing new media texts in a digital era. (…) More recently, these efforts to produce your own media have also been associated with the growing Do-It-Yourself, or DIY, movement (Guzetti & Yang, 2010; Knobel & Lankshear, 2010) involving arts, crafts, and new technologies (Eisenberg & Buechley, 2008; Spencer, 2007). Educators should be especially interested in DIY communities given the amount of time youth voluntarily spend in intense learning as they tackle highly technical practices, including film editing, robotics, and writing novels among a host of other activities across various DIY networks.”
